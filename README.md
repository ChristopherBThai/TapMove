## How to play

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible. You can tap around your screen to move your character. and your main objective is to avoid black circles while collecting white ones. 

There are three ways to die:

1. Falling off the screen
2. Colliding into black circles
3. Running out of time

There are several different types of hostile circles throught the game. As you live longer, more difficult and unique enemies will appear.

Your character has a time limit of 30 seconds. As your timer goes down, the screen will get darker and darker until your counter reaches 0, which then, you will die. To regain some more time, you must collect white orbs that will randomly appear across the map.

You are also able to dash, but will use up 25% of your time when used. Dashing is executed by flicking your finger in the direction you want to go. While dashing, your player is immune to death.
